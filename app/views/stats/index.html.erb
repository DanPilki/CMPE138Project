<h1>Stats</h1>
<p>this page is working too</p>
<p>This page is gunna be loaded with an argument in the link, depending on the player chosen it will change what stats it shows ex: if Curry is clicked on it will show curry's stats but if durant is clicked on it will show KD's stats. Saves us from making 10-15 different stat pages, one for each player</p>
